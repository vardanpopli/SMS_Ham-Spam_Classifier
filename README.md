# SMS_Ham-Spam_Classifier

This repository contains detailed methodology and code for a machine learning model designed to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham). The main model utilized in this project is Na√Øve Bayes, with other machine learning models also experimented with and documented in the 'main' file within the repository. 

Few Data Preprocessing steps has been done in this project-- can be seen within 'main', folowed by EDA which includes Bargraphs, Pichart, Histograms, Heatmaps, Wordcloud.

The model is evaluated based on the precision (Since, the data has greater Non-Spam target than spam target)

# Dataset
The dataset used in this model is taken from the kaggle ('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset?resource=download'). It is also documented in csv format.

# Model 
This documentation the Trained model.pkl on on the given dataset usin Multinomial Naive Bayes

# Vectorizer 
This documentation contains the trained tfidf vectorizer.pkl, which can be used to vectorize the input sentence/SMS.

# Deployment_LocalNet
This notebook contain the code to deploy the model on the Local Host

# Implimentation:
1. Download the Dataset on your Desktop
2. copy the main file to your desired IDE (Or just downlaod the trained model and trained vectorizer)
3. Run the Deployment code
